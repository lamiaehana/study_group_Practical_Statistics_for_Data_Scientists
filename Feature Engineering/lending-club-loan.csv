My goal is to use any addtional available cash to prepay this loan and be debt free (other than mortgage and student loan), with 36-48 months.<br/>",debt_consolidation,Consolidation Loan,972xx,OR,6.85,0,1987-07,750,754,0,,,6,0,22595,0.628,22,false,0.00,0.00,40030.733778469505,39997.37,30000.00,10030.73,0.0,0.0,0.0,2016-08,666.52,,2016-09,794,790,false,,true,INDIVIDUAL,,,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,false,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,false,,,,

I have asked a certain bank for a rate reduction; however, I was informed that possible reductions only take place every six months for individual accounts. My ""review process"" is due in December.  <br><br> In my opinion, I am a good borrower because I have the ability to pay back loans in a timely manner. I have always paid above any minimum amounts due. I have paid any accounts before due dates and typically have paid off loans before the initial end of the loan. I have only had one late payment in the previous three years and that was a credit card annual fee added to my account from Capital One in the amount of $29. I would have paid the amount; however, I did not know the amount was owed until it was too late. I carried a zero balance on the card and I saw the added fee as a ""punishment"" for not using the card. In any case, Capital One would not budge or remove the fee. It was eventually paid, yet Capital One never removed the derogatory marks from my credit report. <br><br> I have been an independent freelance safety consultant since 2008 and business is very stable.

I did, however, have an issue with Capital One back in February of 2009 where a $29 &quot;annual&quot; fee was assessed to an unused card and the amount was unknown to me. I called to get the fee reversed, but Capital One did not budge.

This past year I had too many large expenses come up (needing new tires, my cat was hospitalized twice, an expensive medical procedure with a portion not covered by insurance).

My income while in school ($54,000), will be more than enough to cover my monthly expenses and the repayment of this loan.  Monthly Expenses:  Rent (utilities included): $600 (NOTE: Rent will be $0 once I begin school. I will be living with family to be closer to the campus)  Car payment: $600  Insurance: $120  Phone and food:$300  Thank you for your time and interest in funding my loan.

I had to use credit cards, high interest credit cards at that, to help my brother and grandmother deal with severe financial troubles over the past couple of years. They are now financially stable, and I do not have to provide any additional support for them in the future. I can pay my current bills on my current budget. However, I am paying a ridiculous amount of interest on a few credit cards. I am looking to pay those cards down to reduce the amount of interest I pay each month. My only credit flaws are a public record for a fraudulent claim filed by a former landlord (from 7 years ago), and high debt-income ratio. The debt-income ratio will greatly improve over the next few months as I concentrate my resources to pay off my debt. I live in a house that was a gift from my father, so I have no mortgage payment, and I own two vehicles free and clear. I have a very stable job, and I have been employed with current employer for two years. I was employed with my previous employer for six years.

I want to consolidate to one payment and lower interest. It breaks out like this, Discover Card $4200.00 (29.9%) and the remaining $11,800.00 Discover Financial Personal Loan (19.9%).<br/>I accumulated this debt, in part due to medical debit when I was under insured.  I took out a loan at the time to consolidate that and car work debit.  <br/>I wasn&rsquo;t making that kind of money. So basically my rates were a little higher than normal.  I have worked hard over the past two years to get it down.  I am in a position now to consolidate under a new lower rate.  My Lending Club Rate is (15.98%).<br/><br/>Financial Situation: I have been working with my company for more than three years now.  The company is very stable and has seen growth over the past two years.  They provide technical services to Fortune 500 companies.<br/>Also, in November of this year, I am going to be moving in with a roommate.

Looking back I should have listed a loan for more than I did the last time.  I did not pay off one credit card which was at 2.99%, but I was able to double the payments every month and had planned to have the card paid off the same time the Lending Club loan was paid.  Since that time however, with the economy the way it is, I have had to cut back on the payments I make on the credit card and I will no longer be able to have it paid off in 3 yrs.  I'm finding that it is much easier to budget if I had just one &quot;loan&quot; payment per month.  This 24,000 will enable me to pay off my 3 yr Lending Club loan, the dept credit cards (which both have small balances) and the big credit card amount and still have money left to cover incidentals and adding more to my savings each month.  I realize this will add an additional 2 years to my planned retirement, but then again, the economy might improve in a couple of years and I will be able to make bigger payments to pay this loan off earlier.  I have managed to handle my bills in a timely manner, but I would like to make my life a little easier.

I had time to peruse the prospectus, I was surprised at the # of folks sharing such personal info. It's disheartening how todays economy has struck so many GOOD HARD WORKING folks. I will venture an educated guess the majority of us have just gotten blind-sided by the ever increasing costs of EVERYTHING from med ins to heating fuel to gas. It just never seems to end. More stringent rules &amp; regs were put in place to protect the financial intitutions. Ok fine, but how the honest, hard working folk, who have &amp; are trying so to hard to STAY in the game, nevermind GET AHEAD, supposed to do just that when no one gives us the chance? I've worked very hard for 8 years to bring myself back from a really hard time and have done VERY well for myself and have not faltered.  But unless youre credit score is in the 800's and have a 2nd income at home, banks just don't wanna talk to ya....Anyway, yes, the interest may be higher but I'm glad I found Lending Club, and the op to pre-pay w/out penalty exists if I am able in the future should my loan request fully fund! I have a goal - a strategy - 1 loan to pay off some debt w/ the much higher interest which will eventually facilitate looking for a house. A positive outlook and a little bit of faith go a looong way! I think it would be prudent to mention as well the &quot;initial loan&quot; imentioned was/in not w/ Lending Club.

The purpose of this loan is to provide the final tranche of funding for a long-planned, extensive interior renovation of my home. I purchased the home in October 2009, and got a great price because of the remodeling that was needed.   The person I bought the house with took off four months after we moved in, leaving me with the mortgage (I hold full title to the house), and in the financial scramble that followed, my credit rating took a hit, as I took out a bunch of credit cards and had to carry balances.  Since then, I have landed a job that pays more than both of our combined salaries when we bought the place. I am an in-house lobbyist for a clean energy company, in a senior position with a stable, annual salary.   I have a monthly disposable income of $4700--after mortgage payments. I have a tenant to help defray the mortgage, and this renovation will help make the house more comfortable for two people who do not share a bedroom. Right now the layout for the kitchen and common areas are cramped and poorly thought out--the house was originally flipped.  I've done as much work on the house as I can with my own hands--extensive landscaping and a new patio. Now it is time to work on the inside, and I am no plumber or carpenter or electrician. Because I haven't been in the house long, I'm not eligible for a home equity line of credit, but I do have a homeowner's loan and a personal loan from a credit union--however, banks are conservative these days and my credit score is still recovering from last year, so it is not quite enough.  I am turning to LendingClub to put me over the top for the renovation which this house needs, so it can be the place I envisioned when I bought it nearly two years ago. Home values are going up in my neighborhood, but I need this work to allow my home to express its true worth, and to be more livable for me and a tenant, as well to be more attractive any renters or sellers in the future should I ever move.   But I'm not planning to move for a while. I love my house. But the tiny kitchen and bathroom are starting to drive me bonkers. Thanks to all potential investors for helping me realize the wonderful home I have been waiting for.   I am happy to answer any questions, and thank you.  Update:   Thanks to everyone who has invested so far--this is an exciting process, and I hope we can get all the way to the goal in these last few days.

No defaults or late payments EVER. Have worked the monthly loan payments into my budget and there is room to spare to include personal savings/reinvestment or quicker loan payoff. Looking forward to smooth funding!<br/> Borrower added on 07/24/11 > TO those who have invested, thanks for your faith! For prospective investors, let me outline my plans:<br/><br/>WIth funds received, I have 6 low limit credit cards with APRs between 15.99-21.99 that will be paid in full &amp; closed.  The total of these accounts are $7,100. Paying off the cards I have with the highest rates is a smart move - saving me from paying extra interest down the road. The Lending Club interest rate affords me this savings.<br/><br/>That leaves +/- $3,500 after loan fees. This amount will be used to pay 2 cards with balances that I will continue to work off.

Our recent addition of auto service has really boosted our sales. We believe the only thing slowing us down is our current location.

We have crunched all the numbers and have found that we only have to average 4 billable hours of labor a week to pay all the business expenses. We are already billing more than this at our current location. So I am giving each investor who will give me this opportunity that you have my word that you will be repayed in full and on time.

If funded for this loan, I intend to pay off 7 accts and discontinue use of 4 of those accounts. The current loan payment is scheduled for $304 .66/mo but I can afford to pay $500-$600/mo and pay off the loan in 24 mos, sooner than the 60-month term offered. I pay my bills on time, I always pay over the min monthly payment requirement, and can afford my current debt and monthly expenses without this loan but Im hopeful for the help to pay this debt off sooner rather than later with the help of the lower APR than my current avg APR so I can better invest in my home improvement projects and rebuild the equity in my home so that I may refinance down the road, pay down my HELOC at a faster rate and better provide for my retirement.

The reason for my request is twofold: (1) I am one payment away from paying the balance of two short-term debts. The monthly payments on these debts are more than the monthly payments needed to service the monthly payments for the requested loan. As the sole co-signer for a college loan for I am responsible for a past due balance on one of two loans which requires ongoing payments although my son is still enrolled as a full time student. The loan I am requesting will be used to cover the delinquency on the loan which is over 120 days past due. <br/><br/>(2) The only delinquency on my credit profile is related to this past due payments on the loan and has had a negative impact on my credit rating. When many of my creditors (particularly the banks) lowered my overall available credit (in one case by as high as 90%) to levels close to my overall balances my credit rating was negatively impacted. This put my overall balances closer to my overall credit limits although I did not incur any additional debt. With just this, one-change creditors drastically affected the credit profile of many consumers who were otherwise in good standing. I will use the balance of the loan to cover outstanding medical bills not covered by my medical and dental insurance.<br/>",debt_consolidation,Debt Consolidation Loan,070xx,NJ,13,0,1996-10,690,694,0,,,6,0,2832,0.345,23,false,0.00,0.00,3414.449999999919,3176.16,2361.13,584.34,14.895630038139,454.09,64.8324,2013-10,117.92,,2016-09,499,0,false,,true,INDIVIDUAL,,,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,false,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,false,,,,

The business is doing well, and has exceeded its break- even point.<br/>The business has been great for the community, and I will work hard to maintain, and even enhance the relationship and services.<br/>Thanks for your interest in my loan application; I look forward to receiving your funds.<br/>",small_business,Small Business,347xx,FL,17.77,0,2000-12,675,679,3,73,,16,0,3425,0.184,31,false,0.00,0.00,1341.36,945.50,486.76,854.60,0.0,0.0,0.0,2011-10,671.01,,2016-09,669,665,false,,true,INDIVIDUAL,,,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,false,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,false,,,,

The other half of the loan will be for security deposit for my new place and just a few pieces of furniture.<br/> Borrower added on 07/18/11 > I'm so fortunate to have been offered an interest rate that is well within my budget. I feel comfortable enough to manage my loan in three years. I'm glad I looked around instead of considering any of those other offers I've been receiving.<br/> Borrower added on 07/19/11 > Good news is I re-evaluated my finances and found an additional item I can pay off with the LC loan. I've also decided I can live with one less furniture piece than I initially wanted for my new apartment. This will definitely help me comfortably pay my LC loan in three years. I'm very grateful for the LC Investors and hope to get fully funded very soon. I will only commit to a Lease/Landlord if I know I have the funds. Thank you LC Investors for making it happen. Again, I am very thankful for your help.<br/>",moving,Lending Club,900xx,CA,12.09,1,2002-01,680,684,0,20,,6,0,2769,0.712,10,false,0.00,0.00,6586.381235374996,6586.38,6000.00,571.38,15.000000036658,0.0,0.0,2012-08,4420.08,,2016-09,549,545,false,,true,INDIVIDUAL,,,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,false,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,false,,,,

As is the case with any house with over a century of wear there is a great deal of work that needs to be done. Over the course of the last 18 months I have been making a series of improvements starting by replacing 22 original single-pane windows, new exterior/interior paint, and 2nd floor carpeting.  Upcoming projects include kitchen tile, plaster work, replacement of the 35 year old gas furnace, and the much needed addition of air conditioning. <br/>My goals are straightforward - to consolidate the credit card debt that I have incurred over the last 18 months and complete my remaining home improvement projects.  My financial goal is to eliminate all debts including the proceeds of this loan by the end of 2014. I have a well-established career with the means to fulfill the financial obligations requested.   <br/>Thank you for your consideration.<br/>",debt_consolidation,Home Improvement & Debt Consolidation,152xx,PA,3.94,0,1996-12,770,774,1,,,8,0,9271,0.237,29,false,0.00,0.00,20197.056873492304,20168.65,17775.00,2422.06,0.0,0.0,0.0,2014-07,608.34,,2014-07,684,680,false,,true,INDIVIDUAL,,,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,false,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,false,,,,

The funds will be an extension to the bridge of capital on-hand to assist in expanding our business and making necessary purchases and upgrades that will not only improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our internal operations, but also greatly enhance the customers' overall shopping experience. We will use the funds for the following: A cash register with robust storage and automation capabilities; more shelving for the larger storage room; a larger company sign, advertisement in adjacent communities, small customer and employee incentives, inventory scanners, aesthetic details and upgrades that appeal to the senses of our customers, a larger retail space. What makes me a good borrower is my history with the Lending Club as well as my credit score. We obtained some funding when we opened the doors to our company last year. In just a short amount of time we were able to pay that loan off in full. I am in the U.S. Army so my income is more than stable. I earn a comfortable salary, and I have a little more than 10 years until I retire. My business partner and I are not fans of debt. We barely have any. I have a cell phone bill, and car insurance payments. I receive a housing stipend so my rent, food, and utilities are paid by the military. My best friend and business partner has a cell phone bill, drives a scooter (paid for with cash and has a $20 per month insurance bill), and is pursuing his MBA. He is totally immersed in the world of business and believes in providing for the business first. So other than books for school and maybe an occassional quick bite from a restaurant his debt is minimal as well. We whole-heartedly believe in living well below our means. Our life is our company, and we enjoy the sweat we put into it while watching it grow. We see no need in going through banks to apply for business loans with minimums of $50,000-$150,000. Those amounts do not match the steady and calculated pace of our business. After Lending Club was featured on CNBC earlier this year, my partner and I knew we were in the among great company, and chose to come back to where we started for capital supplementation.<br/>",small_business,Expansion,735xx,OK,0,0,2002-04,775,779,2,,,2,0,0,0.00,18,false,0.00,0.00,29617.8699192191,29547.44,21025.00,8592.87,0.0,0.0,0.0,2015-05,7033.62,,2015-06,744,740,false,,true,INDIVIDUAL,,,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,false,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,false,,,,

For the last 6 months we've been starting up our business and have now found ourselves in a windfall of large orders. Our buyers are large North American chains such as Homegoods, Winners, TJMaxx, Ross Stores and private label production. We're averaging 32% profit currently and our orders have increased at 200+% for the last 4 months. Currently I work full time a a large US bank while getting this company started with my business partner. I am a majorirty owner with great credit. We are using this money to finance the purchase of inventory for the next 60 days and secure a warehouse with a full loading dock at the request of our clients. We've had to turn 3 orders down ($21,700 in profit) due to the lack of liquid cash and want to grow catiously as to not overwhelm our company and ourselves. Currently we are producing at a pricepoint that is low compared to our comeptition. We are working through learning how to efficiently produce our products and prove our company in the tooth and nail world of wholesale so that within the next 12 months we can launch a premium, retail product where profit is over 50%. Projected sales for this year are now in excess of $400,000. <br/><br/>The pet industry is one of the few that weathered the economic woes of recent. In fact, in the most recent APPA report over 30% of respondants said they would sacrifice for themselves to spend more on their pets. Premium pet treats are growing quickly and have a solid trackrecord of sustained growth over the last 10 years. <br/><br/>We appreciate you taking the time to look at this and hope you can help us get to the next level. Please feel free to contact us with any questions you may have.<br/> Borrower added on 07/08/11 > Just to clarify, I currently have a full time job in addition to owning this company. I intend on keeping that job until this company is running and profiting around $20,000/month which will most likely be September. I could pay this loan off early without a question given the cash flow of the company but I'd probably keep it for at least a year which would allow me to use it as a buffer should we get another large order.

I take my debt and credit standing very seriously. My financial standing is solid and I'm trying to be smart in keeping it that way by attempting to pay the least amount of interest possible, on my existing debt. I plan to pay off this loan possibly before the end of the term, but in case I use the full loan term, at least I will have paid less in interest vs. my current credit card rates. I have a stable job in a very stable company, in a very stable field. I pride myself of being a responsible individual, with a very stable life, and I wouldnt do anything to jeopardize that. I truly believe I am a good borrower not only because of my history, but because my cash flow would benefit when using the loan to pay my credit cards balance.  I realize investing in someone you don't know is a big risk, but hopefully my credit history will substantiate my worthiness. All I want to do is pay off some high interest credit card debt that I incurred-in for reasons beyond my control.

I would like to thank all the investors who have already responded to my posted loan request. <br><br>I would like to provide more information in the hopes my full posted loan request is funded.<br><br>For five years, a snowball effect of financial mishaps and hardships has occurred. Some I could have avoided; some I could not. Bottom line, I have been unsuccessful gaining control of my debt because many of these debts are carried with high interest rates.  I have been unsuccessful negotiating lower interest rates with my creditors. I recently developed a spreadsheet listing all my debt. I had a rude awakening when I was able to see of my $721 monthly credit payments, $251 is toward interest (35%). <br><br>The purpose of requesting a $12,000 loan is to finance my high interest debt into a low interest loan. Through this loan, and paying off high interest debt, I project my monthly credit payments to be $675 with $130 towards interest (19%), allowing me the opportunity to comfortably pay off my debt in about three years. <br><br>I have been placing money into a savings account (difficult to access) for unplanned financial mishaps and hardships with the goal of avoiding the use of credit cards (I have cut them up!). <br><br>I have a secure job within a financially sound healthcare organization which I have been employed for ten years. Spring 2012, I enrolled in College with the goal of acquiring a degree in Accounting.  I am currently carrying a 3.88 GPA. I plan to graduate June 2013. Through College business classes I have learned how I CAN improve my financial situation.<br><br>I am loyal with my credit payments. However, I would prefer the opportunity to have most my monthly credit payments applied towards the principal so I can pay my debt off sooner.

I wish to consolidate my debt to a lower interest rate to pay it off quicker and cheaper. Once approved, I will close two credit cards that have risen to very high interest rates (Household Bank and Chase) and increase my savings regiment to avoid using my revolving credit lines except for special cases where I would need enhanced transaction protections, such as air travel or online purchases, and in any case would be able to full pay the balance on such purchases by having saved the money beforehand. My plan would leave me with just one credit card with a locked-in, low fixed rate for such uses and nothing more.

If anyone is curious, I choose 3 years here because I can safely and consistently make those monthly payments on time in case any emergencies may appear down the line.<br/>",major_purchase,Debt Loan,601xx,IL,1.32,0,1998-08,805,809,0,,,4,0,1425,0.093,14,false,0.00,0.00,22144.5549919531,22116.10,20000.00,2144.55,0.0,0.0,0.0,2013-08,7235.83,,2016-09,759,755,false,,true,INDIVIDUAL,,,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,false,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,false,,,,

I have had loans and credit cards in the past and always paid on time and over the minimum due. I am very secure in my job as a store manager.

The restaurant also has a very low overhead since we have free rent for 2 years after opening day. After the 2 year free rent it will increase to 1000.00 per month which is very cheap for the area and size. We will open the day after the loan is funded.

The income listed in not household but individual. This credit card has been paid off slowly from 22k to 7780 in a year and a half. The problem is everytime I make a huge payment, the credit card company lowers the credit limit to whatever I paid. For instance I made a 10k payment. Then they lowered the limit 10k. This affects my credit score and debt to ratio. I have never been late on a payment.  The credit card company claims that they have been affected by the economy and those whom filed chapter 13/7. So they are lowering credit limits to off set their loss. It's upsetting. I worked hard to have my credit score be in the excellent range, I never asked for a credit increase. They increased it, and when I used it with the intention to pay off in 2 years. They are now lowering it as I pay off, which affects me. I will cancel this card if my loan is funded.

I am attempting to secure funding to obtain the services of a attorney in addressing a delicate, embarrassing legal matter involving the consequential, logistical, non-medical impact of disease/disorder which has victimized our household.<br/><br/>In doing so, unfortunately, this comes to me in the form of a flat-fee retainer for an attorney's services which would ultimately exhaust my cash savings buffer quicker than I am comfortable with. That being said, my ability and commitment to fulfill my financial obligations to my lenders should be considered unmatched. By trade, I am a budget analyst, I have an expert knowledge of managing a financial portfolio, spending and I am subject to loss of my career, clearance and honor were I to default. These are not things I take lightly.<br/><br/>I have a stable career in the military, although I make a modest salary. As an Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) I will have served over nine years in January. I reenlisted this last year as well during my fourteen-month tour downrange which I've just returned from, and  which will take me to a total of twelve and a half years by the time my next reenlistment rolls around.

The balance on one card is $4800 with 22% interest and $4700 with 20.5% interest.  I'm not sure how the interest rates crept up that high, as I have never been late with a payment, but I suppose that's how they get you.  I obtained both cards back in college and both had a $500 limit.  I paid the balance off in full each month and I was rewarded with credit limit increases until both were at $5k each (now much to my dismay). <br/><br/>I bought a home in April 2009.  The home was a foreclosure and I ended up using the credit cards to make it livable on the hopes of a promotion that I was in line for at work.  That promotion never came to fruition and I was stuck with the high balances.  Fast forward a year and I now have stable employment with the federal government, along with a higher salary, and I want to rid myself of these credit cards now.  One is already cut up, the other is for emergencies only.  I plan on using this loan to pay the balances of both off in full.  Whatever funds remain (~$1000) will be placed into a rainy day emergency fund.

I've been there for almost 4 years now with complete confidence in my job stability.  If anything my income will only grow in the coming years as I move up.<br/><br/>I have not used a credit card for a while for the express purpose of paying them off.  I live rent free at home, paid off my car, and expenses outside of that are minimal and more than manageable to always meet any loan payments.

I have paid down some of that debt since graduating but if I consolidated my debts I believe my credit score would improve and I would save money. I think my rates on my credit cards would also decline if I consolidated since my credit score would improve.<br/><br/>Credit Quality:<br/>- I have never paid a bill late<br/>- My credit score is low because of my limited credit history<br/>- Generally speaking, in a typical year by bonus is equal to my base salary. My bonus is paid in January each year. Last year I earned a little over $125,000 in base and bonus combined. This year my base has increased to over $100K <br/><br/>Expected Payoff:<br/>- I can easily meet the monthly payments on this 3 year loan. After paying all my loan interest payments, rent, and recurring bills each month I have about $2,500 of disposable income each month. <br/><br/>Savings:<br/>I have about $30K is my IRA which constitutes the majority of my net worth but that is not liquid. If I lost my job, which I believe is highly unlikely, I would be able to access some of that IRA without penalty to make sure I could pay my bills like the interest on this loan.<br/> Borrower added on 06/23/11 > Additional Details:<br/>I was not specific enough when I talked about how much debt I had coming out of college.  After my 1st year bonus I retired all of my student loans.  So in my first year I paid down about $10,000 of student loan debt.  Last bonus I paid down about $5,000 of credit card debt.  Today I have roughly $12,000 of remaining credit card debt with interest rates between 10% and 29%.  I also have a car loan for a certified pre-owned car I purchased last year for my commute to work.  On that loan my interest rate is 3.9% and my monthly payment is under $300 a month.<br/><br/>Please submit additional questions as they arise.

As an active duty military member, I have been deployed for 8 of the last 10 years, and found it difficult to achieve the financial security I was hoping.  While I do have college savings and a home, I would rather not tap into those secure investments to pay off my credit cards.  Instead, this loan will allow me to pay off my credit card debt within 5 years, and at the same time allow my savings and home to continue to appreciate.  I have never defaulted on a loan, including a home loan, and I have no intention of ever defaulting on my financial obligations. That is exactly why I are hoping to pay off our revolving debt with this loan. The easy answer would be to go to a credit counseling company, but it is my obligation to pay off my debt, which is what I will do with this structured loan.  Just as I serve my country with honor, I also honor my commitments, including my financial commitments.  Thank you for your favorable consideration.<br/> Borrower added on 06/27/11 > I would like to add, that my long, positive credit history supports the fact that I honor my financial committments, having never once defaulted on a debt.  This includes my home, which I proudly pay each month.  Although offered a huge mortgage during the mortgage gold rush, I only assumed a loan that was within reason given my income.  As a result, I have never been late in my five years of owning the home.  In addition, I proudly own a home in full.  So while I have collateral, I would rather not tap into these secure assets, and instead remain disciplined to pay off my credit card debt in 5 years while my assets continue to appreciate.<br/>Thank you again for the response and the favorable consideration.<br/>",debt_consolidation,consolidation,981xx,WA,16.46,1,1984-10,670,674,2,9,,19,0,56301,0.715,47,false,0.00,0.00,29819.7895939506,29779.22,18375.01,11444.78,0.0,0.0,0.0,2016-07,496.18,,2016-09,644,640,false,,true,INDIVIDUAL,,,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,false,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,false,,,,

For example I have been making monthly payments of $150.00 for over a year, and I still only have an available credit line of just $700.00 away from max. This has got to go!!)<br/><br/>My Mom &amp; Dad - $1300.00 who are needing the funds back after a car accident<br/><br/>Grandparents - $950.00<br/><br/>I am currently making these payments per month out of both of my jobs (70 hours per week):<br/><br/>Car Loan - $325.00<br/><br/>Federal Taxes (2010) - have not received bill notice yet, but want to get it paid to avoid more interest!<br/><br/>State Taxes (2010) - have not received bill notice yet, but want to get it paid to avoid more interest!<br/><br/>Credit Card - $150.00 per month (approx $50.00 over Minimum payment amount)<br/><br/>My Mom &amp; Dad - $200.00 per month<br/><br/>Grandparents - $200.00 per month<br/><br/>Should I receive the full amount of my requested loan, it will allow me to cut back to one full time job (45 hours per week). I understand that the loan I am requesting is on the higher side of the interest spectrum, but it is consistent with my current loan interests I am paying. I have been working very hard to improve my financial situation and have succeeded to this point. In fact a year ago, my credit score was in the low 500s and I have now reached the 700s. I have never been late on a payment, and take a lot of pride in that fact!<br/><br/>I again, thank you for your time and consideration in investing in me.

Thank you for your help Lending Club!<br/> Borrower added on 06/22/11 > Thank you for your interest in helping fund my loan.<br/>This loan is officially approved by the lending club.  Please see below notes for clarification on my loan proceeds.<br/>I currently hold three credit cards totaling $35,000.00.  The payments on all three cards total $1,100.00 at an average interest rate of about 23.50%.  This debt is not a cash flow problem as my monthly salary is $15,000.00 per month.<br/>I have no student loans and only one car loan at a great 3.50% rate.  <br/>I have three mortgages on rental properties totaling monthly PITI payments of about $8,000.00 per month.  My net rental income on these properties is $10,000 per month, giving me a solid cash flow.  <br/>The reason for my current balance on the cards was due to recent remodel of a rental property and paying some medical expenses.  Because of credit card indebtedness, my credit score dipped from 740 to 680.  With that said, the plan is to free up these cards to increase my credit score back over 700 and refinance my recently remodeled rental property at a better interest rate.  That refinance will include the payoff of this new loan request.  I hope this paints a better picture for you.

While I very well may earn enough to pay for the entire wedding by November, this is not an event to gamble on.??  I need this loan in order to have the peace of mind to invite our guests to the wedding without worrying about whether or not I will actually have the cash in hand to pay for it.

I only included the amounts above because I am still liable for them during this time, even though the Air Force is paying them as an Enlistment Bonus. So my actual monthly expenditure is less than the above budget.<br/><br/>As far as the stability of my job. I have been working in my current position for 2 years and have no plans on leaving.

This loan is for working capital for a whiskey bar and music venue. We feature drinks and cocktails that hearken back to the Prohibition and Big Band eras, in a return to the elegance of that time. We are the only bar in several towns with a full-size music stage, and we feature at least one band every weekend (mostly blues, bluegrass and rockabilly, although we have had other styles in). We would like to expand into having bands every Friday and Saturday night, as well as an open mic during the week. The owner has experience running a tavern, and he has tons of great ideas for expansion. In addition, he has created jobs for eight other people by starting this business, to say nothing of supporting local bands. The business is up and running, but we are in need of working capital for things like advertising and paying for bands. It is a classy place, and we're already starting to make a name for ourself in our town. We're doing our part to revitalize our downtown area. The owner is already a member of the Chamber of Commerce, and we participate in city chamber events. I have been at my job for over fourteen years, so our ability to repay is secure.

Unfortunately I had to use my credit cards about 5 years ago when I was laid off by my previous employer who told me it was temporary and to just wait a week. That week turned into 4 months before I realized my cards were getting maxed out and took a different job. Since then I have not made as much progress paying down my debt as I would like. While I have made some progress, it's not enough, I want to be debt free in 5 years.<br><br>  I recently purchased a house and rent out several of the rooms to help with my income. I also recently sold my expensive and newer financed cars and instead now have two older used cars with much smaller loans/payments and only 3 year terms (both with about 2 years left, one partially through LendingClub).<br><br>  My accounts, approximate balances, and APRs are:<br> Direct Merchants: $4200 (28.99%)<br> Chase: $3400 (31.99%), $3300 (17.24%), $1200 (29.24%)<br> Citi: $2100 (29.99%)<br> Sears: $2300 (28.99%)<br> Merrick: $2000 (22.99%)<br> Capital One: $1900 (16.15%), $1800 (12.4%), $1000 (19.8%), $450 (14.4%)<br> Best Buy: $700 (29.99%)<br> HSBC: 300 (29.99%)<br><br>  I am aware that some of these cards have lower APRs than the loan I am requesting, however they have annual fees that are expensive, and having just one payment per month will be less stressful for me and worth the few extra dollars to me. I plan on immediately closing all of these accounts except one for emergencies. I am aware that it will damage my FICO score, but I don't want or need any of these accounts or the fees.<br><br>  I have been working for my employer for about 4 years now and it is a full time and very stable position, and I enjoy it very much. <br><br>  I have always made all my payments on time except one in 2006 which was accidentally not updated when I moved and did not give the bank the right address. I missed one payment but have always been on time since then.<br><br>  If you have any questions, please let me know. Borrower added on 06/21/11 > I would like to add that my FICO score is quite low, but only because I recently changed from a big bank to a small credit union.  I also refinanced my two cars through them, and I also looked into refinancing my house with them.  Finally, they extended a line of credit for what they call &quot;Instant deposit&quot; which allows me to mail checks to them but credit my account in the meanwhile.  <br/><br/>As a result, my credit report FICO score took a 40 point hit from around 700 to 660, resulting in my disappointing &quot;F1&quot; score here on LendingClub.  My other LendingClub account before this was rated MUCH more favorably (it was a B or C score I think?) and nothing has changed much in terms of my overall credit standing.<br/>",credit_card,Credit card consolidation loan,201xx,VA,17.78,0,1996-10,680,684,2,,99,15,1,17419,0.579,37,false,0.00,0.00,19892.0608456382,19863.81,17600.00,2292.06,0.0,0.0,0.0,2012-03,16619.03,,2015-09,689,685,false,,true,INDIVIDUAL,,,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,false,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,false,,,,

One of the individual's has the direct experience needed to manage the daily operations and personnel of a confectionary kiosk and the other has the experience in managing the finances. Partnering with these individuals allows me to own the business but also keep my current employee status where I have been working for 22 years and would be easily able to pay the monthly payment if necessary. Throughout our business plan we have made very conservative estimates of our monthly cash workflow and I am very confident that the business will not only be able to pay all of its required expenses but within the first year finish with a positive profit margin.

I recently obtained approval for a medical loan, but was unable to use the funds because my doctor does not accept financing. Apparently, when medical offices work with financing companies, they incur a fee that they cannot legally pass on to clients. So, I am seeking cash financing so that I can pay my doctor with cash or check rather than with &quot;traditional&quot; financing, which would cost him money to accept. <br/><br/>About me: I have had a stable job in the Legal/Compliance industry for over 6 years. In March I used my annual bonus to pay off all of my credit card debt and to fully fund my Roth IRA. I did not want to use the cash for the surgery when I still had debt, so I prioritized and paid off my debts and funded my retirement for 2010. In addition to my full-time career, I also own a three-family house with tenants who cover the mortgage. Although I don't have the lump sum of cash available, I make enough to cover the payments of the loan I am seeking. <br/><br/>Thanks for your consideration!<br/> Borrower added on 06/14/11 > Below is a breakdown of my budget.

And then I'm not using either credit card unless a true rainy day strikes (i.e, massive car repair or a true life-and-death emergency), and in the meantime I have already started funding my rainy day savings account, so I won't be side-tracked by life's normal and real emergencies.<br/> Borrower added on 06/12/11 > I added notes previously, but the system won't let me go back and see them to edit or alter them, so here's a second attempt to explain my reason for seeking this credit card consolidation loan.<br/><br/>I owe approximately $26,000 on 2 separate credit cards with APRs of 13.24% and 12.9%, respectively. The monthly payment I was averaging on the two of them came to be in excess of $700, a comfortable-for-me monthly payment. With this loan, I eliminate the highest interest debt in my life, and pay down by half the other one. But the less-than-$700/month payment to LC will allow me to do these other things:<br/>1) Restore my rainy day fund, so I can be prepared again for life's little events and not have to resort to a credit card to handle an unplanned expense.<br/>2) Give my money to someone who is willing to take a chance on me during a time when my credit card companies refused to increase my credit line, so I could consolidate my card debt with them.<br/>3) It says to mention why I'm a good borrower. Simply put, I've never been late on a payment because I'm diligent about all bills that I owe and ensuring they are paid on time.<br/>4) Which leads into my line of work. My company is a defense and government contractor. While the nature of our work is contract-based, I support multiple efforts and work well with both my co-workers and all of my bosses, all of whom like and respect my work. If one task were to go away, they would place me on other assignments rather than simply let me go.<br/>",credit_card,Chase Card Consolidation Loan,229xx,VA,15.6,0,1994-11,745,749,0,,,6,0,27119,0.745,23,false,0.00,0.00,22371.816741492396,22371.82,20000.00,2371.82,0.0,0.0,0.0,2014-05,1093.61,,2014-04,804,800,false,,true,INDIVIDUAL,,,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,false,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,false,,,,

The desire to help and support those in need, whether animal, plant, or person, and the wildness I harbored in my soul, stayed with me long after I escaped the challenging circumstances I grew up in. I eventually channeled those youthful traits into a career in urban education that I love beyond words, even though I endured many hardships along the way, especially financial, in order to find it. The loan I am seeking is for the purpose of consolidating debt I incurred in my twenties and early thirties as I struggled to put myself through college and graduate school, and then tried to find stable employment. Now that I am fortunate to be in a professional position with a great deal of job security, I want control over my financial landscape to be included amongst my accomplishments. Having a single installment loan with one payment due each month and a reasonable interest rate will offset the stress caused by making multiple payments on past debts with high interest rates. Less stress in this area of my life will allow me to have greater focus on those areas that matter most, like helping those I serve become productive, educated citizens able to break the damaging cycles that have wreaked havoc on their lives, those of their loved ones, and their communities. Borrower added on 06/19/11 > I just want to thank all those that have contributed toward my loan and those that will in the coming days. Initially I saw this site as a unique way to secure funds to pay off debt without having to deal with a bank. However, as I watched my loan money increase through individuals' investments, I began to feel a strong sense of accountability to this community of lenders and borrowers. Because I work in social justice and community revitalization, I connect personally with the concept behind Lending Club. I hope others that use this site have an equal level of respect for those that have chosen to funnel their own earnings into someone's loan request. Failure to do so would amount to a shameful act of failing the community as a whole. Ventures such as this only thrive and grow as people commit to the principles and values backing it and see to it that they meet their obligations.

I have an excellent credit score of 776 and a stellar repayment history with absolutely no derogatory items. I pay all bills on time and always have, as my credit report indicates. Building a solid credit history has been a top priority for me, and I've worked hard to ensure this happens. I fully paid off one student loan some years ago and am working on paying down the other. My budget plan will allow me to aggressively pay off my credit card balances in less than 8 months. My monthly budget outline is as follows:<br/><br/>Net Monthly Income: $2948.92<br/><br/>Rent/Renter&rsquo;s Insurance: $615<br/>Groceries/Misc. Household goods: $480<br/>Household Utilities: $116<br/>Transportation (public transit fare): $86<br/>Cell Phone: $88<br/>Student Loan: $100<br/>Credit Card/Consumer Debt Re-payment: $615<br/>Contribution to Savings Account: $100<br/><br/>Remaining: $784.92<br/><br/>Given the above budget, I am more than capable of managing the ~$241 monthly payment of the loan I&rsquo;m requesting. Doing so, I&rsquo;m still left with approximately $545 per month for entertainment and other incidentals. <br/><br/>I work for a well-established importing/distribution company that has been in business for over 20 years. I started with the company in March of 2010 after spending 6+ years with my previous employer and have already been promoted to a higher-paying position with increased responsibility after just 15 months. The company is growing annually and I am thrilled to be part of such a successful, forward-moving organization.<br/><br/>Thank you in advance for considering funding my loan request.

My goal is to create a tutoring website that is free for all students. Grade school, High school and College. The idea came to me when I learned that in cities like New York, Chicago and San Francisco, etc, tutoring can cost as much as $80 per hour. I'm not trying to take anything away from current traditional tutors. I've needed a tutor when I was younger and I was a tutor while in college. Tutors are truly invaluable. My aim is to simply help students who can't afford a private tutor. I already have the business plan completed and the domain name purchased. The money that you loan me will go towards building the website. The goal is to have it open and running by the beginning of 2012. This is my first time trying to start a business and I'd be happy to listen to any advice that you may have. Thank you for your time and contribution.

The reason my score is lower than I would like is due to debt to income ratio, however I do not live paycheck to paycheck.<br/>*Instead of taking a loan for the entire wedding I only want to take out what is necessary and pay the rest with a my savings. <br/><br/>Summary:<br/><br/>I am a very good borrower because I CARE about my credit history and ALWAYS make payments on time. I have stability in my current position and longevity with my employer, I am thought of very highly in my office and by regional and corporate management. I don&rsquo;t want to take credit out for the entire amount because I CAN pay part of the wedding with my own money up front, and I feel this makes me a good borrower and my credit history proves that. Also as I mentioned above my wedding is roughly 11k (destination wedding) this 7k loan will allow us to not stretch ourselves thin as we pay for the wedding, we will be paying the rest (4k) in cash from part of my savings. <br/><br/>I appreciate the review for this loan for us to start the next chapter in our lives. <br/><br/>thank you.<br/>",wedding,wedding loan,436xx,OH,24.62,0,2001-08,700,704,0,,,7,0,16574,0.891,38,false,0.00,0.00,8464.810761714,8464.81,7200.01,1264.80,0.0,0.0,0.0,2014-02,1187.76,,2015-02,704,700,false,,true,INDIVIDUAL,,,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,false,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,false,,,,

I typically pay more than the minimum due but the interest rates and annual fees keep going up and the banks continue to lower my credit line.  This is impacting my debt to credit ratio, which is further impacting my credit score.<br/><br/>Stability:  I've been employed with the same company for 15 years and work in IT.  I have 2 savings accounts and a 401(k) plan that I could easily tap into and pay off all my credit card debt but that would be a last resort.  I want to stay on track with building my emergency funds and retirement savings and at the same time make regular monthly payments against my debt so I can build upon my credit worthiness.<br/><br/>The Numbers:  Currently, my monthly budget allocates $500 towards credit card payments.  The $328 monthly payment on this consolidation loan is set at a lower APR, which enables me to pay off my credit card debt in just 3 years.  At the rate I'm going, it would take at least 7 years to pay them off (longer if they continue to hike up their rates and fees!)

I am new to the Lending Club and so I thought I might share with you why I am looking to the Lending Club for some financial assistance.  <br/><br/>In 2009 I made some bad credit choices by applying for a card from my local bank that carried an annual fee in addition to a high intrest rate.  No, problem, I thought, I won't be using this credit card anyway.  A few months later I got into an apartment and my room mate bailed on me the day I signed the lease.  I now had an apartment which I could not afford all on my own.  I also just got a new job for the new area I was in.  I couldn't afford to stay there but I couldn't afford to break the lease either.  So, I used the credit card to end the lease and move again and get my old job back.  It was a series of poor planning and bad financial decisions.  <br/><br/>If you invest in me, I plan to consolidate all of these high intrest cards (I have 1 and 2 lower intrest cards) and pay them off and close the high-intrest, annual fee one.  I can pay off the last $1800 on my CarMax car loan and be done with that one too.  With just one loan at a better rate I can focus on improving and aquiring a better income by adding on a part-time job.  My plan is to be debt free in 4 years.  <br/><br/>Thank you so much for your intrest in becoming my investor of my debt consolidation loan.  I appreciate your kind welcome and I will be a Lending Club success story.

It was actually supposed to be &quot;The Debt Destroyer Financial Freedom Loan&quot;, but the &quot;Debt&quot; part got cut out for some reason.

I was making pretty good progress in getting the debt paid down, but then the economic meltdown happened and all of my credit card interest rates skyrocketed. Since then I've still managed to make some progress in paying down the debt, but I feel like I'm barely getting ahead. So I decided I'd rather be paying interest to normal people like me than to big banks, and I joined LendingClub.<br/><br/>I've been a software developer since 2002. I've worked for my current employer for about three years. I always pay my bills on time. I've never defaulted on anything. I don't have bad credit.

This loan is being used to pay for my son's wedding and wedding gift---he recently completed an 18-month tour in Iraq, and we couldn't be more elated and relieved that he is finally back home, safe. It will not be the most elaborate wedding, as we are staying budget conscious, but it will hopefully be a beautiful little event that they will always remember.<br/><br/>I was turned on to LC after being directed here by LendingTree. I applied in two places; a credit union, and LendingTree. I received approval from the credit union, and from both lenders that LendingTree (one being here at LC). I never knew of LC before, and after spending several hours researching exactly what it is, reading reviews, and scouring the fine print of the loan agreements/borrower membership agreement, I can't believe I didn't stumble across this earlier.<br/><br/>I decided to go with a personal loan through LC for two reasons; 1) Although I have the available credit lines on my cards, the lowest interest rate right now is around the 15 to 16 percent range, which is nearly triple the LC rate I qualified for, and 2) The entire idea of giving money back to the hardworking people who deserve it, and are kind enough to lend it to others, is just so much better than giving it to the &quot;big boys&quot; that have left me so disgusted these past few years. I am looking into the &quot;Investor&quot; portion of it now, and will hopefully soon be able to assist others in this way.<br/><br/><br/>I don't have much in the way of expenses, as my car is paid off and I have been a homeowner for over 20 years. I am very fiscally responsible, as you can see by the &quot;A3&quot; loan grade, and I have been working in the financial sector for over 25 years. I can't think of much else to add, but I do appreciate you taking the time to read through this and sincerely hope I can get fully funded so that the interest goes back to the P2P lending network rather than the big boys on wall street.<br/><br/>Thanks again, and best regards!<br/>",other,Our little wedding!,331xx,FL,2.58,0,1983-02,805,809,0,,,13,0,3270,0.024,37,false,0.00,0.00,11447.5204983111,11419.74,10300.00,1147.52,0.0,0.0,0.0,2014-06,334.94,,2015-06,759,755,false,,true,INDIVIDUAL,,,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,false,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,false,,,,

This is the perfect business investment loan to invest in for many reasons:<br/>1.  Managing a DVD Now Kiosk does not require me to quit my full-time job.<br/>2. DVD Kiosks are growing faster than any other vending opportunity in the market today.<br/>3. DVD Now competes with Red Box by offering Blue Ray and video games, which Red Box does not offer. Also Red Box only works with large chains like Wal-Mart.  My plan is to put Kiosks on college campuses, which Red Box doesn't touch.<br/>4. DVD Kiosks are set to explode.  Brick and mortar stores are closing and are being replaced by Kiosks which are much cheaper to run, yet can still bring in almost as much revenue.<br/>5. Investing in DVD Kiosks now is like investing in ATM machines in the early 80s, we are now in the ground floor stage.<br/>6. I have a degree in business, and over 7 years of sales, route sales, and inventory management experience.  All of which will help me with this endeavor.<br/>7.  Red Box kiosks have 3 revenue streams, as opposed to Red Box's one: rentals.  With a Red Box Kiosk, every time a customer rents a DVD, Blue Ray Disk, or Video Game, they are presented with the option to purchase.  Also DVD Now provides advertising space on their kiosks, which provides the kiosk owner with a steady monthly stream of income.<br/>",small_business,DVD Now Kiosk,244xx,VA,9.26,0,2002-12,755,759,0,30,,5,0,27265,0.645,10,false,0.00,0.00,4483.18,4469.17,2200.23,1801.94,0.0,481.01,5.64,2012-06,28.16,,2016-09,499,0,false,,true,INDIVIDUAL,,,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,false,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,false,,,,

Not only to the doctors and hospitals but also to my loving family who pulled together to help me while I was down.  I have a clean lending record for more than three years.  I have paid off and purchased several cars.  I have paid off a dental loan in full.  In the past five years I have not missed a single payment or paid late on any of my credit lines.  I work in a large medical group in California.  I have been there for three years and have no intention of leaving the practice.  Before this current position, I was with my last employer for two years. I was laid off during the financial crash of 2008.  My monthly budget can more than cover the repayment amount, I may even be able to pay the loan off early.  I am normally very stable.  However, with this recent illness, I'm struggling and just need a little help to get back on track.

Then, I further help my financial position by consolidating two higher interest debts into this loan.<br/><br/>Keeping finances healthy is of paramount importance. I have a family and feel it's critical that I maintain my credit and take care of my obligations, I have healthy cash flow to do this. I am at a stage in my life where stability is very important.

My first loan was several years ago and a few thousand dollars used for a startup business. That business is now thriving and the loan is almost fully paid off. There are zero late payments.<br/><br/>My credit score is 750 and I have watched it like a hawk over the last 3 years to bring it up quite a bit. I have zero late payments and never had any other issues with my credit. I am really not sure why LC gives me such a low rating when my credit is so great. I will do anything to make sure it keeps going up.<br/><br/>This loan is for a new (used) car. I am getting a 2009 Scion complete with full warranty. These are very cheap but extremely reliable vehicles.<br/><br/>I have been self employed for the last 6 years running websites and I make pretty decent money. Now I was recently hired as a consultant to another internet development firm and I will need a car to get to/from work. The scion is the cheapest most reliable option I have found. The total cost of the car is around $10,000 and I will be paying the rest with cash.<br/><br/>I am a very trustworthy borrower and obsessively watch my credit to make sure I am always going up.
